                and I have a passion for coding. The sense of satisfaction that comes with creating something from scratch is one that I constantly crave. As a full stack web developer with a background in self-management, I am a proud graduate of the University of California, Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp. Currently, I am seeking a full-time role as a web developer, and my expertise in various web development skills can be found on my Resume page. I am a quick learner who is dedicated to enhancing my abilities. Collaboration is key to me as I value teamwork and consider myself a team player. Problem-solving is another area in which I excel, and I enjoy tackling new challenges, treating each one like a unique puzzle. Hard work and self-improvement are my driving forces, and I am always looking for ways to be more creative and innovative in my approach to web development. My experience in web development has opened up a whole new world of possibilities, and I look forward to creating even more exciting projects in the future.
